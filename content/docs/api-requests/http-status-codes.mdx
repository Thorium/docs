## HTTP Status Codes

ClearBankÂ® requests return a HTTP status code to indicate the success or failure of a request. For successful requests, we return a HTTP `2XX` status code. For failed requests, we return a HTTP `4XX` or `5XX` status code. Some endpoints return JSON response bodies that include errors and additional properties.

#### 5xx status codes
If you receive a 5xx error code, you should retry your request as these are service errors. A request that returns these errors may, in exceptional circumstances, result in being processed regardless. Following which, you will receive a notification (webhook) delivered to you as expected. 

To avoid any duplication, always retry all such requests with exactly the same request Id header and payload. If the initial request is successful, the retry request will trigger a notification (HTTP response or webhook) to confirm that it has not been processed as it was identified as a duplicate.

#### Example of a response containing detailed errors

```json
{
  "errors": {
    "additionalProp1": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp2": [
      "string"
    ],
    "additionalProp3": [
      "string"
    ]
  },
  "type": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "status": 0,
  "detail": "string",
  "instance": "string"
}
```
