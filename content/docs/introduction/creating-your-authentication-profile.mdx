## Creating your authentication profile

Your ClearBankÂ® authentication profile links your institution to your public key. Therefore, it must be valid.

Your authentication profile is a combination of:

- A Key Pair (public/private)
- A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format*
- A token


*In the simulation environment, a CSR can be generated using Open Source solutions. In the production environment, a CSR must be generated using a FIPS 140-2 level 2 compliant Hardware Security Module (HSM) such as Azure KV HSM, Amazon CloudHSM, GoogleCloudHSM (this is not an exhaustive list).

### Follow these steps to create a valid authentication profile

- Generate your Public Key and Private Key pair in PKCS #8 format*
- Generate your Certificate Signing Request (CSR) in PKCS #10 format which contains your certificate and Public Key
- Save your CSR as a .csr file
- Sign in to the Institution portal
- From the menu, select **Institution > Certificates and Tokens**

*In the simulation environment, you can utilise Open Source tools to store your Private Key. In the production environment, you must use a physical or virtual HSM solution to store your private key (see HSM requirements above)

- Click the Generate API Token button

- You can copy the token directly or copy it to your clipboard using the button provided
- Ensure that you store your token securely now. Otherwise, you will need to generate a new one
