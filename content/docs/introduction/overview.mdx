## Overview

The ClearBank® API is a JSON RESTful API which allows you to seamlessly integrate your system with our Banking as a Service (BaaS) platform. Our API enables you to open and manage accounts and process transactions in near real-time. We use [webhooks](/docs/webhooks) to deliver transaction confirmation notifications and account-specific reconciliations to your system as soon as such events occur on your account.

The ClearBank® API is available for consumption by financial institutions, Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) regulated businesses and fintech companies which have been onboarded with ClearBank®.

If you’re any of the above and would like to connect with ClearBank®'s API, please click [here](https://clear.bank/eligibility-criteria) to apply.
