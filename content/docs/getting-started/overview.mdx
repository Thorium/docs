## Overview

Before you can integrate with our API, you need to have been onboarded by us as a customer and have a valid authentication profile set up.
This authentication profile includes your Digital Certificate and secure API token. The API token needs to be included in the header of all REST API calls.
You can find information about how to generate these in our [introduction section](/docs/introduction).
